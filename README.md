-------------

Moped is tested against MRI 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, and JRuby (1.9).

Usage
-----

```ruby
session = Moped::Session.new %w[127.0.0.1:27017]
session.use "echo_test"

session.with(safe: true) do |safe|
  safe[:artists].insert(name: "Syd Vicious")
end

session[:artists].find(name: "Syd Vicious").
  update(
    :$push => { instruments: { name: "Bass" } }
  )
```

## Features

* Automated replica set node discovery and failover.
* No C or Java extensions
* No external dependencies
* Simple, stable, public API.

### Unsupported Features

* GridFS
* Map/Reduce

These features are possible to implement, but outside the scope of Moped's
goals. Consider them perfect opportunities to write a companion gem!

# Project Breakdown

Moped is composed of three parts: an implementation of the [BSON
specification](http://bsonspec.org/), an implementation of the [Mongo Wire
Protocol](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Mongo+Wire+Protocol), and the
driver itself. An overview of the first two follows now, and after that more
information about the driver.

## Moped::BSON

`Moped::BSON` is the namespace for Moped's BSON implementation. It's
implemented in pure (but fast) ruby. The public entry point into the BSON
module is `BSON::Document`, which is just subclass of `Hash`, but exposes two
class methods: `serialize` and `deserialize`. `serialize` accepts a
BSON::Document (or Hash) and returns the serialized BSON representation.
`deserialize` does the opposite: it reads data from an IO-like input and
returns a deserialized BSON::Document.

### Moped::BSON::ObjectId

The `ObjectId` class is used for generating and interacting with Mongo's ids.

```ruby
id = Moped::BSON::ObjectId.new # => 4f8583b5e5a4e46a64000002
id.generation_time # => 2012-04-11 13:14:29 UTC
id == Moped::BSON::ObjectId.from_string(id.to_s) # => true
```

<table><tbody>

<tr><th>new</th>
<td>Creates a new object id.</td></tr>

<tr><th>from_string</th>
<td>Creates a new object id from an object id string.
<br>
<code>Moped::BSON::ObjectId.from_string("4f8d8c66e5a4e45396000009")</code>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>from_time</th>
<td>Creates a new object id from a time.
<br>
<code>Moped::BSON::ObjectId.from_time(Time.new)</code>
</td></tr>

<tr><th>legal?</th>
<td>Validates an object id string.
<br>
<code>Moped::BSON::ObjectId.legal?("4f8d8c66e5a4e45396000009")</code>
</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

### Moped::BSON::Code

The `Code` class is used for working with javascript on the server.

```ruby
Moped::BSON::Code.new("function () { return this.name }")
Moped::BSON::Code.new("function (s) { return s.prefix + this.name }",
  prefix: "_"
)
```

### Moped::BSON::Binary

The `Binary` class allows you to persist binary data to the server, and
supports the following types: `:generic`, `:function`, `:old`, `:uuid`, `:md5`,
and `:user`. Note that `:old` is deprecated, but still present to support
legacy data.

```ruby
Moped::BSON::Binary.new(:md5, Digest::MD5.digest(__FILE__))
```

## Moped::Protocol

`Moped::Protocol` is the namespace for Moped's implementation of the Mongo Wire
Protocol. Its public API consists of classes representing each type of message
in the protocol: `Delete`, `GetMore`, `Insert`, `KillCursors`, `Query`,
`Reply`, `Update`, and a convenience class `Command`.

You should never have to worry about protocol objects, but more details can be
found in the API documentation if you're interested.

# Driver API

This is the core, public API for Moped. It lives almost entirely in four classes:

* `Session`: the root object for all interactions with mongo (c.f., `db` in the
  mongo shell).
* `Collection`: for working with collections in the context of a session
* `Indexes`: for manipulating and inspecting a collection's indexes
* `Query`: for querying, as well as modifying existing data.

What follows is a "whirlwind" overview of the Moped driver API. For details on
additional options, and more examples, use the [generated API
docs](http://rubydoc.info/github/mongoid/moped/master/frames).

## Session

### Example
```ruby
session = Moped::Session.new %w[127.0.0.1:27017 127.0.0.1:27018 127.0.0.1:27019]
session.use :moped_test
session.command ping: 1 # => {"ok"=>1.0}

session.with(safe: { w: 2, wtimeout: 5 }) do |safe_session|
  safe_session[:users].find.remove_all
end

session.with(database: "important_db", consistency: :strong) do |session|
  session[:users].find.one
end
```

users.drop
users.find.count # => 0.0

users.indexes.create({name: 1}, {unique: true})

users.insert(name: "John")
users.find.count # => 1.0

users.insert(name: "John")
users.find.count # => 1.0

session.with(safe: true) do |session|
  session[:users].insert(name: "John")
end # raises Moped::Errors::OperationFailure
```

session[:users].indexes.create(
  { name: 1, location: "2d" },
  { unique: true }
)
session[:users].indexes[name: 1]
# => {"v"=>1, "key"=>{"name"=>1}, "ns"=>"moped_test.users", "name"=>"name_1" }

session[:users].indexes.drop(name: 1)

# Exceptions

Here's a list of the exceptions generated by Moped.

<table><tbody>

<tr><th>Moped::Errors::ConnectionFailure</th>
<td>Raised when a node cannot be reached or a connection is lost.
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> this exception is only raised if Moped could not
reconnect, so you shouldn't attempt to rescue this.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Moped::Errors::OperationFailure</th>
<td>Raised when a command fails or is invalid, such as when an insert fails in
safe mode.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Moped::Errors::QueryFailure</th>
<td>Raised when an invalid query was sent to the database.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Moped::Errors::AuthenticationFailure</th>
<td>Raised when invalid credentials were passed to `session.login`.</td></tr>

<tr><th>Moped::Errors::SocketError</th>
<td>Not a real exception, but a module used to tag unhandled exceptions inside
of a node's networking code. Allows you to `rescue Moped::SocketError` which
preserving the real exception.</td></tr>

</tbody></table>

Other exceptions are possible while running commands, such as IO Errors around
failed connections. Moped tries to be smart about managing its connections,
such as checking if they're dead before executing a command; but those checks
aren't foolproof, and Moped is conservative about handling unexpected errors on
its connections. Namely, Moped will *not* retry a command if an unexpected
exception is raised. Why? Because it's impossible to know whether the command
was actually received by the remote Mongo instance, and without domain
knowledge it cannot be safely retried.

Take for example this case:

```ruby
session.with(safe: true)["users"].insert(name: "John")
```

It's entirely possible that the insert command will be sent to Mongo, but the
connection gets closed before we read the result for `getLastError`. In this
case, there's no way to know whether the insert was actually successful!

If, however, you want to gracefully handle this in your own application, you
could do something like:

```ruby
document = { _id: Moped::BSON::ObjectId.new, name: "John" }

begin
  session["users"].insert(document)
rescue Moped::Errors::SocketError
  session["users"].find(_id: document[:_id]).upsert(document)
end
```

# Replica Sets

Moped has full support for replica sets including automatic failover and node
discovery.

## Automatic Failover

Moped will automatically retry lost connections and attempt to detect dead
connections before sending an operation. Note, that it will *not* retry
individual operations! For example, these cases will work and not raise any
exceptions:

```ruby
session[:users].insert(name: "John")
# kill primary node and promote secondary
session[:users].insert(name: "John")
session[:users].find.count # => 2.0

# primary node drops our connection
session[:users].insert(name: "John")
```

However, you'll get an operation error in a case like:

```ruby
# primary node goes down while reading the reply
session.with(safe: true)[:users].insert(name: "John")
```

And you'll get a connection error in a case like:

```ruby
# primary node goes down, no new primary available yet
session[:users].insert(name: "John")
```

If your session is running with eventual consistency, read operations will
never raise connection errors as long as any secondary or primary node is
running. The only case where you'll see a connection failure is if a node goes
down while attempting to retrieve more results from a cursor, because cursors
are tied to individual nodes.

When two attempts to connect to a node fail, it will be marked as down. This
removes it from the list of available nodes for `:down_interval` (default 30
seconds). Note that the `:down_interval` only applies to normal operations;
that is, if you ask for a primary node and none is available, all nodes will be
retried. Likewise, if you ask for a secondary node, and no secondary or primary
node is available, all nodes will be retreied.

## Node Discovery

The addresses you pass into your session are used as seeds for setting up
replica set connections. After connection, each seed node will return a list of
other known nodes which will be added to the set.

This information is cached according to the `:refresh_interval` option (default:
5 minutes). That means, e.g., that if you add a new node to your replica set,
it should be represented in Moped within 5 minutes.

# Thread-Safety

Moped is thread-safe -- depending on your definition of thread-safe. For Moped,
it means that there's no shared, global state between multiple sessions. What
it doesn't mean is that a single `Session` instance can be interacted with
across threads.

Why not? Because threading is hard. Well, it's more than that -- though the
public API for Moped is quite simple, MongoDB requires a good deal of
complexity out of the internal API, specifically around replica sets and
failover. We've decided that, for now, it's not worth making the replica set
code thread-safe.

**TL;DR**: use one `Moped::Session` instance per thread.
